# AI Chatbot with NLP

## Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a simple AI chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is built with Python and leverages popular NLP libraries such as NLTK and SpaCy. It is capable of responding to user queries based on predefined patterns and simple text processing.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenizes user input and removes stopwords using NLTK.
- **Pattern Matching**: Uses NLTK's `Chat` class to match predefined patterns and generate responses.
- **SpaCy Integration**: Loaded the SpaCy English model for more advanced NLP processing (if required).
- **Simple Interaction**: The chatbot can handle basic queries like greetings, "How are you?", and "What is your name?".
- **Customizable**: The chatbot's responses can easily be extended by adding new patterns.

## Requirements

To run this chatbot, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- `nltk`: For text processing and pattern matching.
- `spacy`: For advanced NLP processing and loading the English language model.
  
### Install Libraries

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk spacy
